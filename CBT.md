# CBT 

**Connected Block Textures (CBT)**, tile textures or texture torture is a minecraft activity involving the connection of pain or constriction to the block textures. 
This may involve directly painful activities, such as stitching textures, rendering magic, texture spanking, squeezing, texture-busting, texture flogging, tile play, tickle texturing, block-connecting-electrostimulation, drawing or kicking. 
The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via aesthetics, or emotional pleasure through block humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic user. 
**Many of these practices carry significant health risks.**

## Devices and Practices
**Texture Stitcher**

A texture stitcher is an object that is used to elongate the texture and provide a feeling of weight pulling the texture away from the block. 
This can be particularly enjoyable for the user as it can make the aesthetics more intense, as textures are prevented from moving up. 
Intended to make one's textures permanently hang much lower than before (if used regularly for extended periods of time), 
this object can be potentially harmful to the user's eyesight as the seams of blocks can be easily cut off if over used.

While leather stitchers are most common, 
other models consist of an assortment of blockrenderers that fastens with screws, 
causing additional but only mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer's textures. 
The size of the stitcher may vary from 100-400 lines of code.
A more dangerous type of texture stitcher can be home-made simply by wrapping rope or string around one's textures until it is eventually stretched to the desired length. 

**Baked Model Crusher**

A Baked Model Crusher is an object made from either shitty code or often clear bytecode hacks that squeezes the baked model slowly by usage of nested for loops. 
How tight it is clamped depends on the pain tolerance of the person it is used on. 
A Baked Model Crusher is often combined with blockentity renderers, either with a friend or by oneself.
