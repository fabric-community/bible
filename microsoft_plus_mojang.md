# Microsoft plus Mojang

> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Mojang, is in fact, Mojang Studios, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Microsoft plus Mojang. Mojang is not a development studio unto itself, but rather another division of a fully functioning Microsoft company made useful by the Microsoft Xbox, Windows and vital microtransactions comprising a full game as defined by the European Union.

> Many computer users run a modified version of the Minecraft game every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Minecraft which is widely used today is often called Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically *the* Minecraft game, developed by Mojang Studios.

> There really is a Minecraft, and these people are playing it, but it is just a part of Microsoft. Mojang is the Minecraft development studio: the development studio that allocates the developers to the other Minecraft games. The studio is an essential part of a game-making process, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete parent company. Mojang is normally used in combination with the Microsoft operating system(s): the whole system is basically Microsoft with Mojang added, or Microsoft/Mojang. All the so-called Mojang games are really games made by Microsoft/Mojang!
